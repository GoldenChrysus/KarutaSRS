<div class="ui segment">
	<h4 class="ui header">The Basics</h4>
	Everything you learn in {{@model.name}} first begins with lessons. You can access these by clicking the "Lessons" link in the navigation menu. You can do five lessons per day. Each lesson item is a poem and information about that poem. You will be quizzed on the items listed as "quiz items" in the section below. The section below with {{@model.first_poem.name}}'s poem is a demonstration of what your lesson queue will look like.

			<h5 class="ui header">Kimariji</h5>
			<em>Quiz Item</em>
			<p><em>Kimariji</em> are the key characters of the first verse needed to accurately identify a poem. For example, in the first lesson below, the <em>kimariji</em> are {{@model.first_poem.kimariji}}. In a game of karuta, you would hit the appropriate card after hearing {{@model.first_poem.kimariji}}.</p>

			<h5 class="ui header">2nd Verse Key Characters</h5>
			<em>Quiz Item</em>
			<p>The "2nd verse key characters" are the characters that uniquely identify the second verse. In the lesson below, the key characters for the second verse are {{@model.first_poem.second_verse_answer}}. In a karuta game, after hearing the <em>kimariji</em> {{@model.first_poem.kimariji}}, you would immediately try to hit the card that begins with {{@model.first_poem.second_verse_answer}}.</p>

		<div class="four wide column">
			<h5 class="ui header">Audio & Card</h5>
			<p>Every lesson has high quality audio of the reading as it would be in a game of karuta. On the right side of each lesson is a visual playing card with the 2nd verse key characters highlighted in blue to help you visualize the card in a game.</p>

		<div class="four wide column">
			<h5 class="ui header">Background & Translation</h5>

	To navigate the queue, desktop users should click each item labeled 1 through 5 at the top of the queue, then you will be allowed to proceed to the lesson quiz. Note that you cannot proceed to the lesson quiz using the queue below, as it is only a demonstration. Mobile users can swipe left or right over each lesson to navigate the lessons and proceed to the quiz. A lesson's quiz must be passed before the poem will enter your review queue.

	<h4 class="ui header">Try It Out</h4>
	Try out the demonstration review below. The first review is for the <em>kimariji</em> since the review is displaying the full playing card. The card starts with {{@model.first_poem.second_verse_answer}} which you learned are the 2nd verse key characters from the poem in the above lesson. The <em>kimariji</em> for this poem (and the correct answer for the review) is {{@model.first_poem.kimariji}}. You can enter <em>hiragana</em> by typing <em>romaji</em> into the input below the card. For example, you can enter "tago" and it will automatically convert to {{@model.first_poem.kimariji}}. Hit enter to submit your answer.

<div class="ui segment">
	<h4 class="ui header">Review Feedback</h4>
	Once you submit your answer, the input box locks and will turn red for an incorrect answer or green for a correct answer. An "Item Info" dropdown will also appear so you can review the lesson if you've forgotten the poem. For 2nd verse key character reviews, the <em>hiragana</em> will appear on the card as you type it. Like the input box, incorrect characters will change to red and correct characters will change to green when you submit your answer. Try continuing the demonstration review above. It will alternate between the <em>kimariji</em> review and the 2nd verse key character review. Try submitting both correct and incorrect answers to see the various colored feeback provided.
