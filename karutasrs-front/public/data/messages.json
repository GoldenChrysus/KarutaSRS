However, to ensure users learn the correct karuta information, the following poems have been reset for all users: 26, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 60, 71, 78, 88, 95. We apologize for the inconvenience. Karuta SRS is still in alpha, and we want to ensure it is the most reliable and accurate tool for everyone wanting to learn karuta."
